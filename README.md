# Personal website
#### This repo will be the starting point to making a personal website that introduces myself, Abdullah Al Khafaji, to potential employers or clients. I aim to illustrate some experience in web design including front-end development and back-end development. 
##### The website this repo links to is: https://alkhafaji.netlify.app/

#### I will eventually add another index.html inside this repo to link to another page, but currently it's in working order.
